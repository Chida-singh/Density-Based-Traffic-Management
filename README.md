# Density-Based-Traffic-Management
This project implements a smart traffic signal system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The system dynamically adjusts signal timing based on real-time vehicle density at an intersection. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve efficiency.
