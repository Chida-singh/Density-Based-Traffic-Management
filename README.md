# Density-Based-Traffic-Management
This project implements a smart traffic signal system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The system dynamically adjusts signal timing based on real-time vehicle density at an intersection. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve efficiency.
## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **smart traffic signal system** using **Arduino** and **ultrasonic sensors**. The system detects vehicle density and dynamically adjusts signal timing to optimize traffic flow. 🏙️  

## 🛠️ Features  
- 📡 **Real-time vehicle detection** using ultrasonic sensors  
- ⏳ **Adaptive signal timing** based on traffic density  
- 🔄 **Dynamic switching** between signals for smooth flow  
- ⚡ **Efficient and automated** traffic management  

## 🖥️ Components Used  
- 🔹 **Arduino Uno / Mega**  
- 🔹 **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)**  
- 🔹 **LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) for Traffic Lights**  
- 🔹 **TimerOne Library for Interrupts**  
- 🔹 **Resistors & Jumper Wires**  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. 🔎 **Ultrasonic sensors** measure the distance of vehicles at each intersection.  
2. 📊 If the distance is **below a threshold**, the system detects traffic congestion.  
3. 🚦 The system **adjusts the signal timing dynamically** to allow vehicles to pass.  
4. 🔄 The cycle **repeats** based on real-time traffic density.
